# TicTacToe
## First project for General Assembly SEI
### After completing the minimum requirements for the project, I added styling/functionality in order to better-familiarize myself with JS/CSS/HTML methods that I had either not used before, or wanted practice with.

### I added the following, beyond the bonus requirements of the project:
- A new font
- Button hover effects
- Animations for:
    - Game title
    - Board initialization
- End-game confetti (on a win)
- Color picker for each player
- Can't input once a game is won/tied
- Audio events for: 
    - Game start
    - Player win
    - Player turn
